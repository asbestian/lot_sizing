Introduction
============
   
This repository implements different mixed integer programming (mip) formulations for the discrete,
single-machine, multi-item, single-level lot sizing problem.

A `problem description <https://github.com/asbestian/lot_sizing/blob/master/doc/problem_description.pdf>`__ and
a mathematical description of the 
`mip formulations <https://github.com/asbestian/lot_sizing/blob/master/doc/mip_formulations.pdf>`__
can be found in the `doc` folder.
